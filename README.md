# 🌱 **Farm-to-Market: Quality Prediction Platform for Farmers** 🌱

## 📜 **Project Overview**
Farm-to-Market is a web application designed to help farmers predict the quality of their produce and sell it directly to buyers, eliminating the need for middlemen. By using cutting-edge image processing and machine learning, farmers can upload images of their products and receive accurate quality predictions, enabling them to set fair prices and increase their profits.

## 💡 **Features**
- 📸 **Image Upload**: Farmers can easily upload images of their farm produce.
- 🔍 **Quality Prediction**: The system predicts the quality of the product using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
- 🛒 **Direct Sales**: Connects farmers directly with buyers, cutting out intermediaries.
- 💵 **Fair Pricing**: Transparent pricing based on the predicted quality of the produce.

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Image Processing**: Python (OpenCV, NumPy)
- **Database**: MySQL, PgAdmin

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. Farmers upload an image of their farm produce.
2. The system processes the image using machine learning models to predict quality.
3. The predicted quality helps farmers set fair prices and connect directly with buyers.
4. Farmers benefit from increased profits by bypassing intermediaries.

## 🎯 **Goals**
- 🌾 Empower farmers by providing tools for accurate quality prediction.
- 🏪 Facilitate direct sales between farmers and buyers.
